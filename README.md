# LEGO.scad

An OpenSCAD LEGO-compatible brick generator.

This parametric brick takes the work of https://github.com/cfinke/LEGO.scad a few steps further, taking the schema closer to being fully-compatible with LEGO bricks.

Likely you will need a print at a resolution of 100-microns or finer for the prints to turn out well.
